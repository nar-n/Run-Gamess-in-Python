# Run-Gamess-in-Python
## This is a small python script to run DFT calculations using open-source QM package, GAMESS (General Atomic and Molecular Electronic Structure System).
This Python script uses GAMESS to run DFT calculations for multiple input files specified in an a specific directory.
The first thing you need is to download specific (Windows) version of Gamess from "https://www.msg.chem.iastate.edu/gamess/download.html". In our case, we choose the latest Windows version of gamess (2023.R1.intel). Detailed instructions on installing Gamess can be found on the provided link.
Once you've defined the location of your input files within the script, executing it will generate outputs saved in the same directory.
